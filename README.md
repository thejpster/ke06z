# Rust drivers for Cortex-M0+ based Freescale KE06Z (and relatives)

The Freescale KE06Z is a Cortex-M0+ based microcontroller. Unusually, it can be operated in a 5V I/O mode, making it suitable to replace an Atmel AVR based Arduino system.

For a bare metal example program written in Rust (https://rust-lang.org) for the FRDM-KE06Z developer board using this crate, see [kinetis-frdm](https://github.com/thejpster/kinetis-frdm).
